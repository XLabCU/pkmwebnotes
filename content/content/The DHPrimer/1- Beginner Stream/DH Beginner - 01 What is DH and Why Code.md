# DH Beginner - 01: What is DH and Why Code?

## What is Digital Humanities (DH)?

At its core, Digital Humanities involves using computational tools and methods to ask and answer humanities research questions. It's a broad field, but common activities include:

*   **Text Analysis:** Analyzing large amounts of text (books, articles, social media) for patterns, themes, or stylistic features.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating charts, maps, and networks to explore and present humanities data.
*   **Digital Archives:** Building and analyzing digital collections of historical artifacts, texts, or images.
*   **Computational Linguistics:** Using computers to understand language structure and usage.

## Why Use Code?

While many DH tools have graphical interfaces (GUIs), learning to code (like using Python) offers several advantages:

1.  **Scale:** Code allows you to analyze vastly more data than you could manually read or process (e.g., analyzing thousands of novels).
2.  **Automation:** Repetitive tasks (like finding all mentions of a name in a collection of letters) can be automated, saving time and reducing errors.
3.  **Customization:** You can tailor your analysis precisely to your research question, going beyond the limitations of off-the-shelf software.
4.  **Reproducibility:** Code provides a clear record of your analytical steps, making your research transparent and reproducible by others.
5.  **New Questions:** Computational methods can reveal patterns and insights that are difficult or impossible to see through traditional reading alone.

Don't worry if this sounds complex! We'll start very simply. Let's get your hands dirty with your very first piece of code in the next note.
