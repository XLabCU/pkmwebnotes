# DH Beginner - 11: Wrap-up and Next Steps

**Congratulations!** You've reached the end of the core DH Beginner sequence.

You started with the fundamental question of "What is DH?" and have progressed through the essential building blocks of Python programming for humanities applications.

**What You've Accomplished:**

*   Understood the **value of coding** for DH research (scale, automation, customization, reproducibility).
*   Learned to execute Python code and use the `print()` function.
*   Worked with fundamental **data types** (strings, integers, floats) and stored them in **variables**.
*   Organized multiple items using **lists** and accessed their elements.
*   Created, wrote to, and **read text files** – a crucial skill for handling humanities data.
*   Automated repetitive tasks using **`for` loops**.
*   Performed basic **text cleaning** by removing punctuation.
*   Used **dictionaries** to store key-value pairs.
*   Combined these skills to perform a foundational DH task: calculating **word frequencies**.

These skills form the bedrock for many digital humanities methods. Being able to read, manipulate, and analyze text programmatically opens up new avenues for exploring humanities questions at scale.

**Where to Go From Here?**

1.  **Practice:**
    *   Try applying the word frequency code to a different, perhaps longer, text file. You can often find plain text versions of books on sites like Project Gutenberg.
    *   Experiment! Change the code, try different cleaning methods (e.g., removing numbers), and see what happens.
    *   Modify the scripts to answer slightly different questions (e.g., How many lines are in the file? What's the average word length?).

2.  **Explore Further Python Concepts:**
    *   **Functions:** Learn how to package reusable blocks of code.
    *   **Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`):** Make decisions in your code.
    *   **More Data Structures:** Explore tuples and sets.
    *   **Error Handling (`try`/`except`):** Write more robust code.

3.  **Introduction to DH Libraries (Potential next learning steps):**
    *   **NLTK / spaCy:** More powerful text analysis (tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition).
    *   **Pandas:** Working with tabular data (like spreadsheets or CSV files).
    *   **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Creating data visualizations (charts, graphs).

4.  **Continue with the Primer:**
    *   When you feel ready, move on to the [[DH Intermediate - Start Here]] strand (content forthcoming) for more advanced techniques.

Keep experimenting and applying these tools to texts or data that interest you. The most effective way to learn is by doing!
