# DH Advanced - Start Here

Welcome to the Advanced Strand!

This strand is designed for users who have a solid grasp of the concepts and techniques covered in the [[DH Beginner - Start Here]] and [[DH Intermediate - Start Here]] strands. We'll be diving into more complex methodologies, specialized libraries, and potentially computationally intensive tasks common in cutting-edge Digital Humanities research.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Strong Python Proficiency:** Comfortable with functions, classes (basic understanding), error handling, file I/O.
*   **Pandas Mastery:** Confident in data loading, manipulation, filtering, merging, and aggregation with Pandas DataFrames.
*   **Intermediate Text Analysis:** Familiar with NLTK or spaCy for tokenization, POS tagging, stop word removal, frequency distributions, stemming/lemmatization.
*   **API Interaction:** Experience fetching and parsing data (likely JSON) from web APIs using `requests`.
*   **Basic Visualization:** Ability to create standard plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** Familiarity with basic DH concepts like text encoding, data structuring, and the rationale behind computational methods.
*   **Environment Management (Recommended):** Using virtual environments (like `venv` or `conda`) to manage potentially complex library dependencies is highly recommended at this stage.

**What You'll Learn (Topics in this Strand):**

1.  **Advanced Text Analysis:** TF-IDF, Topic Modeling (LDA), Named Entity Recognition (NER).
2.  **Network Analysis:** Graph theory basics, creating/manipulating/visualizing networks, network metrics, community detection.
3.  **Geospatial Analysis:** Geocoding, working with vector data (GeoPandas), interactive mapping (Folium).
4.  **Image Analysis:** Basic image processing, measuring visual similarity.
5.  **Audio Analysis & Sonification:** Basic audio feature extraction, mapping data to sound.
6.  **(Potentially):** Introduction to relevant machine learning concepts, working with larger datasets, performance considerations.

Be prepared for more complex code, reliance on external library documentation, and potentially longer processing times. Let's begin by exploring how to represent text numerically in more sophisticated ways.

3.  **[[DH Advanced - 02 Introduction to Topic Modeling with LDA]]**: Explores unsupervised machine learning to discover latent "topics" within a corpus. Libraries: `gensim`, `scikit-learn`.
4.  **[[DH Advanced - 03 Named Entity Recognition (NER)]]**: Focuses on identifying and classifying named entities (people, places, organizations) in text. Crucial for network extraction and geospatial linking. Libraries: `spaCy`, `nltk`.
5.  **[[DH Advanced - 04 Introduction to Network Analysis]]**: Covers the basics of graph theory and how to create, manipulate, and visualize networks (e.g., social networks, citation networks, character interactions). Libraries: `networkx`, `matplotlib`/`plotly`/`pyvis`.
6.  **[[DH Advanced - 05 Network Metrics and Community Detection]]**: Analyzes network structures using centrality measures and algorithms to find clusters or communities within networks. Libraries: `networkx`.
7.  **[[DH Advanced - 06 Geocoding - Turning Place Names into Coordinates]]**: Practical step of converting textual place names (extracted via NER or from structured data) into latitude/longitude. Libraries: `geopy`, external services.
8.  **[[DH Advanced - 07 Geospatial Data Analysis with GeoPandas]]**: Introduces working with geospatial vector data (points, lines, polygons), performing spatial queries, and joining spatial data with other datasets. Libraries: `geopandas`.
9.  **[[DH Advanced - 08 Interactive Mapping]]**: Creates interactive maps to visualize geospatial data and analysis results. Libraries: `folium`, `plotly`.
10. **[[DH Advanced - 09 Introduction to Image Analysis Basics]]**: Covers fundamental image loading, manipulation, and feature extraction concepts. Libraries: `Pillow`, `scikit-image`, `matplotlib`.
11. **[[DH Advanced - 10 Measuring Visual Similarity]]**: Explores techniques to compare images based on their content/features (e.g., color histograms, feature vectors). Libraries: `scikit-image`, `numpy`, potentially `tensorflow`/`pytorch` for feature extraction with deep learning models.
12. **[[DH Advanced - 11 Introduction to Audio Analysis Basics]]**: Covers loading audio, extracting basic features (e.g., amplitude, zero-crossing rate, spectrograms). Libraries: `librosa`, `matplotlib`.
13. **[[DH Advanced - 12 Data Sonification Principles and Techniques]]**: Explores mapping data values onto sound parameters (pitch, volume, duration, timbre) to represent data aurally. Libraries: `librosa`, possibly sound synthesis libraries (`pydub`, `sounddevice`, custom code).
14. **[[DH Advanced - Wrap-up and Further Directions]]**: Summarizes advanced techniques, suggests project ideas, points towards more specialized domains (Deep Learning for DH, Advanced Statistics, etc.).

This sequence builds from advanced text analysis, through relational (networks) and spatial analysis, before moving into non-textual media (images, audio). NER and Geocoding are placed as practical prerequisites before the main network and geospatial sections.
