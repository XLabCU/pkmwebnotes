# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! 

This interactive note making app contains a collection of tutorials and examples designed to introduce you to Digital Humanities (DH) methods using Python.

**How to Use This Notebook:**

*   **Navigation:** Use the `[[Wikilinks]]` (like [[DH Beginner - Start Here]]) to navigate between notes. Mouse over a link, hit ctrl or cmd and click!
*   **Executable Code:** Code blocks marked with `python` can be executed when the note is viewed in `preview`. Results can be copied into a note for safe-keeping (plots can be downloaded as images)
*   **Learning Strands:** The tutorials are organized into three strands based on expected prior experience. Feel free to jump between strands if you feel comfortable.
* **Make Links!** You can put wikilinks around any word or phrase to create a new note from that word/phrase. Cross reference things, add new links to notes, expand and link your thinking. Go to Help --> Open Documentation to see the full possibilities the Tangent environment offers for your note making and learning.
*   **Wiki graph export:** As your thinking develops and you make new notes and add new connections, you can export the graph or network of your thought. The export function provides statistics so that you can identify important ideas or clusters of ideas. You can even visualize your graph in something like [Gephi!](https://gephi.org).
*   **Complete note export:** While your notes are saved automatically in your web browser's memory (or 'cache'), you should download everything periodically onto your own computer. The files you download can be opened with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or similar programs, once you've outgrown this website! You can even open them with [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) extended with the [JupyterLab PKM extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pkm/0.1.12/) for when you want to do some _serious_ DH!

* **Instructors** We've gathered some thoughts on how you might use the DHPrimer in our [[Guide for Instructors]].
