# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PKM WebNotes

This is your personal knowledge management system in the browser.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Editor**: Write notes using simple markdown syntax.
- **Wikilinks**: Connect your ideas by creating links between notes with [[Note Title]].
- **Backlinks**: See which notes link to your current note in the right sidebar.
- **Graph View**: Visualize the connections between your notes.
- **Python Execution**: Run Python code directly within your notes! See the [[Python in Notes]] note for details.

## Getting Started

1.  **Create a new note**: Click the "+ New Note" button.
2.  **Start writing**: Use the editor in the central pane.
3.  **Create a link**: Type [[ and start typing a note title. An autocomplete will appear. Try linking to [[Python in Notes]].`;

## A few more details

            
### Note Management
                <ul>
+ Create and edit notes with markdown support
+ Notes automatically save as you type
+ Real-time preview with syntax highlighting
+ Search through all notes by title or content
+ Notes are sorted by most recently modified
                
### Linking System

+ Create wiki-style links between notes using <code>[[Note Title]]</code> syntax
+ Autocomplete suggestions when typing links
+ Backlinks panel shows which notes link to the current note
+ Broken links are highlighted differently from valid links
+ <b>WARNING</b>: If you change a note name, existing wikilinks to that note will break

                
### Multi-Pane Interface
               
+ Open multiple notes simultaneously in separate panes
+ Split view modes: Edit only, Preview only, or Split (edit and preview side-by-side)
+ Drag the handles between panes to resize them.
+ Double-click resize handles to auto-size panes equally.
+ <strong>NEW:</strong> Click the ðŸ—– button to maximize any pane to full width
+ <strong>NEW:</strong> Use Ctrl/Cmd + M to toggle maximize for the focused pane
            
### Python Code Execution
                
+ Write Python code in markdown blocks (<code>\`\`\`python</code>) and execute it directly in your notes.
+ Click the "â–¶ Run" button on a code block in the preview pane to run it.
+ Standard output (from <code>print()</code>) and the final result are displayed below the code.
  + Load external data (e.g., a CSV file) by adding a special directive to the top of a code block: <code>#data_url: *your_url_here*</code>. The raw text content from the URL will be automatically loaded into a variable named <code>fetched_data</code> for you to use in your script, eg <code>df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(fetched_data))</code>.
+ <b>NB:</b> The first time you run Python code, it may take a few seconds to initialize the environment, during which the app might seem frozen.

### Import and Export
                
+ Import markdown (.md) and text (.txt) files
+ Export options: JSON, individual markdown files, or a single combined file.
                            
### Wikilink Connection Graph Export
    
+ Export as nodes and edges CSV describing the interconnections in your notes
+ Reveals topic clusters and important conceptual bridges in your knowledge base (by calculating modularity and betweeness scores)
+ Identifies isolated notes without connections
