# DH Beginner - 02: Your First Code

It's time to run your first Python code!

**Executable Code Blocks:**

In this notebook, blocks of code look like this:

` ```python `
` # Code goes here `
` print("Hello!") `
` ``` `

To run the code inside a block:
1.  Click inside the grey code area.
2.  Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).

The output of the code will appear directly below the block.

**Your First Command: `print()`**

The `print()` command is one of the most basic and useful in Python. It simply displays whatever you put inside the parentheses `()` onto the screen.

**Try it!** Run the code block below:

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores lines starting with #
# The print() function displays text or variables.

print("Hello, Digital Humanities!")
```

You should see the text Hello, Digital Humanities! appear below the code block after you run it (and _above_ this line!)

**What happened?**

* You told Python to execute the print() function.
* You gave it the text "Hello, Digital Humanities!" as input (this text inside quotes is called a "string").
* Python displayed that string as output.

Congratulations! You've just executed your first line of Python code.
