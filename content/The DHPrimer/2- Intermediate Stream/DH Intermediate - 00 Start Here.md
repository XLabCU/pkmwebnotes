# DH Intermediate - Start Here

Welcome to the Intermediate Strand!

If you're comfortable with the Python basics covered in the Beginner Strand (variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, file I/O) and are ready to tackle more complex tasks and powerful libraries, you're in the right place.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Completion of the [[DH Beginner - Start Here]] strand or equivalent knowledge of basic Python.
*   Understanding of fundamental programming concepts like loops and data structures.
*   Ability to run Python code and manage files (as covered in the beginner series).
*   You might need to install external Python libraries for some notebooks (instructions will be provided).

**What You'll Learn (Topics in this Strand):**

1.  **Working with Tabular Data:** Using the `pandas` library to read, manipulate, and analyze data in table formats (like CSVs).
2.  **Data Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs from your data using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
3.  **Web Scraping Basics:** Using libraries like `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` to extract data from websites (ethically!).
4.  **More Sophisticated Text Analysis:** Using libraries like `nltk` for tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, and frequency analysis beyond basic methods.
5.  **(Potentially)** Introduction to APIs, working with JSON data, basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts.

Let's dive into handling structured data, a very common task in DH.
