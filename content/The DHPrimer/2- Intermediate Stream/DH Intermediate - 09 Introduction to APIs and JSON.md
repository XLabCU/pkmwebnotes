# DH Intermediate - 09: Introduction to APIs and JSON

While web scraping ([[DH Intermediate - 04 Acquiring Web Data - Introduction to Web Scraping]]) allows us to extract data from human-readable web pages, many organizations provide a more structured and reliable way to access their data: **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**.

**What is an API?**

Think of an API as a **messenger** or a defined set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Instead of parsing messy HTML meant for humans, an API often provides data in a format specifically designed for computers, usually **JSON** or XML.

**Why Use APIs?**

*   **Structured Data:** APIs return data in predictable formats (like JSON), making it much easier to parse and use than scraping HTML.
*   **Reliability:** APIs are generally more stable than website layouts. If the website's visual design changes, the API often remains consistent.
*   **Efficiency:** APIs usually provide direct access to the underlying data, potentially avoiding the need to download large HTML pages.
*   **Legitimacy:** Using a documented API is the intended and authorized way to access data programmatically, avoiding the ethical and technical pitfalls of scraping.
*   **Functionality:** APIs can often do more than just retrieve data; they might allow you to submit data, trigger actions, etc. (though many public data APIs are read-only).

**Common API Concepts:**

*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL within an API that provides access to a particular resource or function (e.g., `https://api.example.com/books` or `https://api.example.com/search`).
*   **Request:** Your program sending a message to an API endpoint, typically using HTTP methods like `GET` (retrieve data), `POST` (send data), `PUT` (update data), `DELETE` (remove data). For retrieving data, `GET` is most common.
*   **Parameters:** Options you can add to your request URL (often as query parameters like `?key=value&sort=year`) to filter, sort, or specify the data you want.
*   **Authentication/Authorization (API Keys):** Many APIs require you to register and use an **API key** (a unique string) with your requests to identify yourself and control access/usage limits.
*   **Response:** The data sent back by the API server, typically in JSON or XML format.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Most APIs restrict how many requests you can make in a given time period to prevent abuse. Check the API documentation!

**What is JSON?**

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, human-readable data interchange format. It's become the de facto standard for APIs because it's easy for both humans to read/write and machines to parse/generate.

**JSON Structure:**

JSON data is built on two primary structures:

1.  **Objects:** Unordered collections of **key-value pairs**, enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Keys must be strings (in double quotes), and values can be strings, numbers, booleans (`true`/`false`), arrays, or even other nested objects.
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
      "author": "Jane Austen",
      "year": 1813,
      "available": true,
      "genres": ["Novel of manners", "Romance"]
    }
    ```
2.  **Arrays:** Ordered lists of values, enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Values can be of any valid JSON type.
    ```json
    [ "Sense and Sensibility", "Pride and Prejudice", "Mansfield Park" ]
    ```

These structures can be nested to represent complex data.

**Working with JSON in Python:**

Python has a built-in `json` library that makes working with JSON data incredibly easy.

*   `json.loads(json_string)`: Parses a JSON string into a Python dictionary or list.
*   `json.dumps(python_object)`: Converts a Python dictionary or list into a JSON formatted string.

```python
import json

# Example JSON string (like one you might get from an API)
json_string = """
{
  "query": "Jane Austen",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "austen001",
      "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
      "year": 1813
    },
    {
      "id": "austen002",
      "title": "Sense and Sensibility",
      "year": 1811
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
"""

# Parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary
data = json.loads(json_string)

print("--- Python Dictionary from JSON ---")
print(data)
print(f"Type of data: {type(data)}")

# Access data using dictionary/list notation
print(f"\nQuery term: {data['query']}")
print(f"Number of results: {data['count']}")

print("\n--- Accessing nested data ---")
first_result_title = data['results'][0]['title']
print(f"Title of first result: {first_result_title}")

print("\n--- Looping through results ---")
for result in data['results']:
    print(f"  ID: {result['id']}, Year: {result['year']}, Title: {result['title']}")

# Convert a Python object back to a JSON string
python_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'London'}
json_output = json.dumps(python_dict, indent=4) # indent makes it nicely formatted
print("\n--- Python Dictionary to JSON String ---")
print(json_output)
```

When interacting with APIs using the `requests` library (as we'll see next), you often get the JSON response directly parsed into a Python object using `response.json()`.

APIs, combined with the structured format of JSON, provide a powerful and reliable way to programmatically access vast amounts of data available online, crucial for many DH projects.
